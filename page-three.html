            </h4>
            <p class="card-text">Fideua is the fresh take on the famous paella of Spain, found in Catalonia. This dish swaps out rice with a type of short spaghetti called Fideos. Even though ingredients vary from each restaurant, it is prepared in the same way as paella in a large pan. </p>
            <br>
            <p> Fideos are lightly toasted in a pan before being added to the remaining ingredients such as seafood, tomatoes, and bell peppers, with bases like onion and garlic. In order to give Fideua the toasted finish, it is common that a chef will grill the top of it in the oven before serving. </p>

                Trepat from Conca de Barberà
            </h4>
            <p class="card-text">Conca de Barberà holds a long history of producing some of the best wines in the region. Winemaking here dates back to when the Romans ruled, but was most significant in the middle ages.</p>
            <p>This region is famous for its indigenous grape variety known as Trepat. In recent years, wine makers have had huge success in making medium bodied reds, but traditionally the grape was used for roses. </p>

              Escalivada
            </h4>
            <p class="card-text">Escalivada is a quintessentially Catalan tapas option that remains a firm favourite among catalans. Its name is derived from escalivar, which means to 'roast on ashes'. The dish has a particularly smokey flavour due to this roasting technique. 
            <p> Once charred, the vegetable skin is carefully removed to leave behind the rest of the ingredient. The dish is served with a healthy dose of olive oil and sometimes with garlic for an extra kick. It is common for this food to be served as an accompaniment for meat. </p>

              Cava from Penedès
            </h4>
            <p class="card-text">The Penedès winemaking region, situated just under an hour from Barcelona, is rich in historical tradition. With winemaking roots tracing back to the sixth century B.C., Penedès has progressed to become the foremost wine region in Catalonia. Its varied terrain provides an ideal environment for cultivating a diverse range of grape varieties.</p>
            <p>Barcelona locals frequently opt for Penedès wines, given their wide selection. Apart from offering a diverse range of traditional reds and whites, Penedès stands out as a leading producer of cava in Spain.</p>

                Arròs negre
            </h4>
            <p class="card-text">Arròs negre is a well-known traditional dish in Catalonia and the Valencia region. It shares a preparation method with paella, the key distinction lying in the inclusion of squid ink. This ink not only imparts a dark hue to the rice but also contributes a unique seafood flavor. The dish involves meticulously cooking rice, squid or cuttlefish, garlic, peppers, olive oil, and paprika in a wide, flat pan.</p>
            <p>Because of its unique color, arròs negre is occasionally informally known as paella negra (black paella). Enhance the flavor of this dish by pairing it with a generous serving of aioli for an additional tangy kick.</p>

           White from Alella
            </h4>
            <p class="card-text">Located less than half an hour from Barcelona, this petite region is the proud residence of merely nine wineries. Despite its modest size, Alella compensates with truly remarkable wines. The winemaking tradition in Alella dates back to Roman times and later became the favored choice of wines for the Kings of Aragón's court. Presently, owing to its advantageous proximity to Barcelona, Alella holds the unique distinction of being the world's sole remaining "urban" wine region.</p>
            <p>However, Alella's greatest claim to fame lies in its white wines crafted from the Pansa Blanca (or Xarel-lo) grape. These wines are known for their characteristic lightness, youthfulness, and freshness.</p>
