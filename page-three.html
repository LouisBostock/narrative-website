                Fideua
            </h4>
            <p class="card-text">Fideua is the Catalonian take on the famed paella of Spain. This dish substitutes rice with a type of short, spaghetti-like pasta called fideos. It’s prepared in the same way as paella, though ingredients vary from one restaurant to another. </p>
            <br>
            <p> Fideos are lightly toasted in a pan before being added to the remaining ingredients – generally seafood, tomatoes, and bell peppers, with aromatics like onion and garlic. It's common to finish a fideua with a short blast in the oven, giving the colourful meal a deliciously crispy texture.</p>

                Trepat from Conca de Barberà
            </h4>
            <p class="card-text">Although this popular winemaking region in the Catalan province of Tarragona only received D.O. status in the 1980s, Conca de Barberà holds a long history of producing some of the best wines in the region. Winemaking here dates back to Roman times, but became especially important during the Middle Ages. The unique erosive action of the Francolí and Anguera rivers makes for perfectly fertile soil where 860 growers cultivate their grapes.</p>
            <p>This region is famous for its indigenous grape variety, Trepat. Traditionally used to make rosés; younger, more experimental wine makers have had great success making very elegant medium-bodied reds from this variety in recent years.</p>

              Escalivada
            </h4>
            <p class="card-text">Escalivada is a quintessentially Catalan tapas option that remains a firm favourite among locals. Its name is derived from escalivar, which means to 'roast on ashes' – it's this roasting process that gives the dish a deliciously smoky flavour.</p>
            <p> The vegetarian-friendly dish mainly consists of finely sliced eggplant and bell peppers, but is often accompanied by onions and tomatoes. The charred vegetable skin is carefully removed to leave behind the succulent flesh. The dish is served with a healthy dose of olive oil and sometimes with garlic for an extra kick. Some restaurants serve escalivada as a relish for meat and fish dishes.</p>

              Cava from Penedès
            </h4>
            <p class="card-text">The winemaking region of Penedès, less than an hour away from Barcelona, is steeped in storied tradition. Winemaking here dates back to the sixth century B.C. and has evolved to the point that Penedès is now the most significant wine region in Catalonia. It features diverse terrain, making it perfect to cultivate a wide variety of grapes.</p>
            <p>Penedès wines are among the most popular wines to order in Barcelona among locals due to their variety. In addition to a diverse range of classic reds and whites, it is also one of the foremost producers of cava in all of Spain.</p>

                Arròs negre
            </h4>
            <p class="card-text">Arròs negre is a traditional dish famous in both Catalonia and the Valencia region. It’s prepared in a similar way to paella, with the main difference being the use of squid ink, which both blackens the rice and adds a distinctive seafood flavour. Along with the ink, rice and squid or cuttlefish, garlic, peppers, olive oil and paprika are carefully cooked in a wide and flat pan.</p>
            <p>Due to its distinctive colour, arròs negre is sometimes colloquially referred to as paella negra (black paella). Enjoy this dish with a generous helping of aioli for an extra tangy flavour.</p>

           White from Alella
            </h4>
            <p class="card-text">This small region less than half an hour from Barcelona is home to just nine wineries. However, what Alella lacks in size, it makes up for in seriously spectacular wine. Alella wines were first produced during Roman times and went on to become the personal favorite wines of the court of the Kings of Aragón! Today, due to its privileged location near Barcelona, it enjoys a status as the world’s only remaining “urban” wine region.</p>
            <p>What Alella is most famous for, though, are its white wines made from the Pansa Blanca (or Xarel-lo) grape. These wines are typically light, young and fresh.</p>
